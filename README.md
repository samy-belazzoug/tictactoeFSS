# tictactoeFSS
[School project] The famous Tic Tac Toe game made in Python ! by Samy Belazzoug, Scott Allo and Frederic Pham.

The Tic Tac Toe is a game for two.
Two players choose their side (crosses or circles).
The game takes place on a grid in 3x3, but also in 5x5 or 7x7.
A player wins if he can align a row with his symbol (diagonally, horizontally or vertically).
There is a draw when the grid is full and players have failed to align their symbols.

Our code is functionnal in the Terminal.
We are planning to do an IA for the game.
And also a GUI with Tkinter.
Good game !
